### Ancestry Matching and Sex Checking
This project implements pipelines for ancestry matching and sex-checking based on genotype data. It aims to identify individuals whose genetic data aligns with the GBR reference individuals from the 1000 Genomes project and to validate the sex information in a test dataset.
- Run .R scripts in R-studio
- Run bash pipelines in command line terminal (Mac)
### Data
These pipelines are dependant on the reference and test data (unfortunately, due to data protection concerns they cannot be shared here): ensure PLINK and R-studio have access to the correct files. 

Once the Eigen files have been generated by the 01-define-ancestry-metrics.sh pipeline, they are moved across to the local disk to be accessed by R-studio. Filezilla was used in the case of this report. 

03-define-female.sh produces the .keep file containing information relating to the female's identities (/database/output_files/females.keep), whereas 02-evaluate-ancestry-metrics.r produces the file containing the predicted GBR individuals (eGBR_only).

03-define-female.sh produces the test.sexcheck file which contains the data required for running 04-evaluate-female.r. It is moved across to the local disk to be accessed by R-studio. Filezilla was used in the case of this report
